# Welcome

Simple API to manage employees(CRUD operations)

- Run tests `python manage.py test`
- Run `python generate_dummies.py` to generate 5 random dummy employees(Faker used)
- Run the webapp using ```python manage.py runserver```

- To access documentation:
`localhost:8000/swagger`
- Swagger Documentation has been also exported to a postman workspace
because of an issue I encountered with POST,PUT,PATCH(no inputfield to enter the request body)
